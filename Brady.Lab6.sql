-- Display the names of all customers who bought products from agents based in Teaneck

-- Write a query to check the accuracy of the totalUSD column in the Orders table. 
-- This means calculating Orders.totalUSD from data in other tables and comparing those values to 
-- the values in Orders.totalUSD. Display all rows in Orders where Orders.totalUSD is incorrect, 
-- if any. If there are any incorrect values, explain why they are wrong.

select o.orderNum, o.totalUSD origTotal, round((o.quantityOrdered * prod.priceUSD) * (1-c.discountPct / 100), 7) newTotal
from Customers c inner join Orders   o    on c.pid    = o.custID
			     inner join Products prod on o.prodID = prod.prodID
where o.totalUSD != round((o.quantityOrdered * prod.priceUSD) * (1-c.discountPct / 100), 7);

-- Order numbers 1012, 1017, 1023, and 1026 have a slightly different totalUSD value when calculated from the data in other relevant tables. This is because the original Orders.totalUSD values are not calculated by the database serve but rather were inserted individually when the table was created. The since the new totals are calculated values, there is discrepency in regards to rounding. If the new totals were rounded to two decimal places, only order number 1017 would be different by $0.01.

-- Compare your SQL in #7 (no views) and #9 (using views). The output is the same. How does that work? 
-- What is the database server doing internally when it processes the #9 query?

-- In #9, since views do not actually hold data, the database server will first access the view definition in the system catalog, and then it will use that query to access the specified part of the base tables, in this case a table of People joined with Customers and a table of People joined with Agents. In #7, this is achieved by querying the required tables directly; no separate defining query is necessary. The joins in #7 can essentially broken down to form the views in #9. 


-- 11. (Bonus)
-- Whatâ€™s the difference between a LEFT OUTER JOIN and a RIGHT OUTER JOIN? 
-- Give example queries in SQL to demonstrate. (Feel free to use the CAP database to make your points here.)

-- A left outer join returns all the records from the table on the left of the join statement and the corresponding matching rows from the right table. If the right table does not have the matching record, then NULL is used in its place. 
-- In the example below, all People information is returned along with the Customer information for those who are both people and customers. If a person is an agent, however, the People information is returned, but all Customer information for those individuals is NULL.

select *
from People p left outer join Customers c on p.pid = c.pid;

-- A right outer join is the opposite of the left outer join, in that it returns all records from the table on the right of the join statement and the corresponding matching rows from the left table. A NULL value is again placed where no matching record is applicable. 
-- In the example below, all Customer information is returned and joined with the custID of each order from the Orders table. Since the customer with pid = 7 did not place an order, all Order information for that individual is NULL.

select *
from Orders o right outer join Customers c on o.custID = c.pid;
